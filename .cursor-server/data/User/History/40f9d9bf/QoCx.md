# API Testing Results

## Test Results Summary

All API tests returned **403 Forbidden** with Cloudflare challenge pages, indicating:

1. **Cloudflare Protection**: The API is heavily protected by Cloudflare
2. **Expired Cookies**: The extracted cookies (especially `cf_clearance` and `__cf_bm`) have likely expired
3. **Bot Detection**: Cloudflare is detecting our requests as automated

## Key Findings

### Required Headers (from documentation)
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` - Authentication token
- `Accept: */*` - Content type acceptance
- `User-Agent: <browser_ua>` - Browser user agent
- `Referer: https://sora.chatgpt.com/explore` - Origin reference

### Required Cookies (from documentation)
- `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` - Session authentication
- `cf_clearance` - Cloudflare clearance (expires frequently)
- `__cf_bm` - Cloudflare bot management (expires frequently)
- `oai-sc` - OpenAI session cookie
- `oai-did` - OpenAI device ID

## Challenges

1. **Cookie Expiration**: Cloudflare cookies rotate frequently (minutes/hours)
2. **Bot Detection**: Sophisticated detection requires browser automation
3. **Session Management**: Tokens expire and need refresh

## Recommendations for Implementation

### Option 1: Browser Automation (Recommended)
- Use Puppeteer/Playwright to maintain a real browser session
- Handle Cloudflare challenges automatically
- Keep cookies fresh through browser interaction

### Option 2: Proxy/Session Management
- Implement cookie refresh mechanism
- Use residential proxies
- Rotate user agents and headers

### Option 3: Server-Side Proxy
- Create a backend service that maintains the session
- Frontend calls our API, backend calls Sora API
- Handle authentication and cookie management server-side

## Next Steps

For the MVP, we'll implement **Option 3** - a Next.js API route that:
1. Manages authentication credentials securely
2. Handles cookie refresh logic
3. Provides a clean API for the frontend
4. Includes error handling and retry logic
