## Technical Details

### Block Structure

```typescript
interface CustomFeedBlock {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  searchQuery: string;     // Search term for this block
  durationMinutes: number; // How long to play this block
  order: number;           // Position in timeline
}
```

### Feed Structure

```typescript
interface CustomFeed {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  name: string;            // Display name
  blocks: CustomFeedBlock[]; // Timeline blocks
  loop: boolean;           // Whether to loop
  createdAt: number;       // Timestamp
  updatedAt: number;       // Timestamp
}
```

### Playback Logic

1. **Initialization**: Load first block's search results (shuffled)
2. **Timer**: Set timeout for block duration
3. **Transition**: When timer expires:
   - Load next block's search results
   - Update playback state
   - Schedule next transition
4. **Loop/End**: When reaching the last block:
   - If loop enabled: restart from block 1
   - If loop disabled: stop playback

### Storage

- Feeds are stored in `localStorage` under key `soraCustomFeeds`
- Automatic save on create/edit/delete
- No server-side storage required
